## Processor Interrupt frame

Offset  Register
------  --------------
0       SS                      <-- High memory
4       ESP
8       EFLAGS
12      CS
16      EIP
20      Error code (not always) <-- Low memory
```

## OS Interrupt frame

The asm handler routine must preserve all the registers before calling the C handler function. This
is because every register are not 'Caller preserved' according to the C ABI.

We keep things simple and preserve every general purpose as well as segment registers. Segment
registers as can be seen from the ABI statement, are also not preserved.

EFLAGS register is not preserved in the OS interrupt frame as it is preserved by the processor in
the Processor's Interrupt frame before calling the interrupt handler.
