# BUGS
 
[X] __func__ is giving garbage after paging.s was included.
    If paging.s is compiled with GAS then __func__ is working 
    in the kernel.c

    28th Dec 2020
    Sol: .rodata* section must be before .bss section the KERNEL.ELF file.

# TODOs
 
[X] Can kernel global variables like errno, etc, lie in the kernel, or be 
    placed in the process struct, so that re-entrant kernel problems
    do not occour.
    - Each process has separate kernel data and kernel stack. 
      Thus no conflict, between processes.
